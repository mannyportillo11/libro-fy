# libro-fy :books:

## Motivation
In a world full of many options, sometimes less is better! <strong>Simplify with Libro-fy!</strong> With titles ranging from Alice in Wonderland to The Very Hungry Caterpillar, the average reader spends more time  searching for a book than actually reading. <strong>Libro-fy</strong> is a website that allows their users to create a personal bookshelf on the fly. Users can connect with people from all over the world by upvoting, commenting, and sharing book recommendations. When users login we take away the stress of having to choose a book by offering recommendations based on what you upvote.

## Description: :open_book:

Libro-fy is a full stack application that takes a working Express.js and uses Sequelize to interact with a MySQL database.
The Site was tested through Insomina with packages from npm to start the server. The server accepts different CRUD requests to obtain data for each model.

- Users can GET and POST books to create a personal, <em>virtual</em> bookshelf
- Users can click on a title to find where the book is available
- In Bookshelf, users can select "Check this Book!" to select a single title

## Future Features
- Users are able to connect with a world wide communities to share and acquire new books that they enjoy reading.
- Provide a search bar to select and filter through various categories
- Fetch and link google.api to expand searchable titles
